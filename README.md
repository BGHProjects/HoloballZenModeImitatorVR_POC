# HoloballZenModeImitatorVR_POC

Code adapted from FusedVR tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lagS8EbIY98&ab_channel=FusedVR) to the latest versions of Unity and SteamVR as at 11/1/2021

An imitation of the mechanics of Holoball Zen Mode made with Unity/SteamVR for the HTC Vive

User can 'hit' ball around within a 3D Virtual environment, ball has a trailrenderer so the player can identify it, as well as incoporating the Magnus effect to spin to the balls movement

Ball returns in front of the user if the ball reaches a minimum velocity, and akin to Zen Mode of Holoball, will return to the user if the ball strikes the wall infront of them

Refer to "HoloballZenModeImitator Demo" for a demo of the proof of concept in action
